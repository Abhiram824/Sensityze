      <p style={{color:'black', textAlign:'center', marginLeft:'300px', marginRight:'300px'}}>In the modern day, diversity is becoming a more and more important aspect of company culture and success. It is statistically proven that gender diversity is correlated with more productive companies. Specifically, according to a study by the Boston Consulting Group, companies with more diversity have up to 19% in higher revenues from increased innovation. Despite this strong correlation, company data suggest that corporations lack diversity. According to data from human resources consulting company Mercer, 64% of workers in entry level positions are white. Additionally, positive effects of diversity training rarely last beyond a day or two, and a number of studies suggest that it can activate bias or spark a backlash -  this is the corporate problem we are looking to focus on, specifically insensitive text and speech at companies.  Communication through text and speech is often subjective and can be interpreted as racially and sexually insensitive for several different reasons - a cause for a lot of turmoil within a company. This problem lends a need for digital training programs accessible to people of all races, gender, and sexes, with a more consistently objective technique.</p>
